// Purpose: tl;dr: a program in c++ that couts whatever you want it to but in a prettier way

            a program in c++ that takes in user input through cin and prints input stylistically through cout. currently working on taking in file inputs
            and file outputs. style can be chosen through command line arguments. 
            
            options: a.typewrite - prints input letter by letter on the same line (unless specified) to terminal
            
            command-line args: ./typewriter typewrite [input] [output]
            
// To be updated: 1). taking file inputs and outputs
                  2). adding another printing option that turns strings into enlarged patterns
                  3). modularity and comments/headers
                  
// Compile: g++ -o hoya -Wall -Werror -Wextra typewriter.cpp

// Time taken: 1.5 hr (1/31/2022

// Program files: 

typewriter.cpp: file that includes every implementation, including an int main.
